0,Hulk for sure... still hoping,"Which characters are you hoping don't get awful tier 2s?? The tier 2 system seems to be becoming worse and worse with every update. Despite the high cost to take a character from tier 1 to 2 a lot of them have been really weak. We thought it couldn't get any worse than Black Panther then along came Sin's which was even worse. And the worst ones tend to be most of those in the recent updates. Around half the characters have yet to be given a tier 2. So I thought I'd make this post for a bit of fun to see which characters you don't want to see getting Sin level tier 2s (Sin has 20% dodge, terrible stat increase with only 300 extra HP, check it out in Marvel Universe section) or those similar to the rest of the bad ones. For me it would probably be Hulk (still waiting for more info on his upcoming tier 2) or Captain Marvel as they need a strong upgrade to even compete nowadays and I might even consider quitting if this continues as quite a few characters I use have already received poor ones. Which future tier 2s are you hoping aren't terrible?"

The lack of awareness and resourcefulness among you whiners calling for nerfs is ridiculous. Of course you fail at PVP because you never take the time to learn how to play properly. You expect the game to accommodate your incompetency instead of adjusting to the way the game actually is. The main problem is not overpowered jets. It's bad players trying to play a game mode that they're not cut out for. Watch the good players, in a week's time they'll have their trafficking routes and strategies down pat.

But it's not fun or enjoyable to be pulled out of stealth by triggering an encounter, so that I'm not able to line up a stealth attack. I'm not asking BW to remove all in-between encounters... I'm just asking for more interesting and meaningful npcs rather than waves of boring trash mobs. I know that KOTET will most likey be another story-focused expac, so please consider changing your approach to combat between the story beats. tl;dr version: less filler repetative encounters in KOTET that are just there to prolong the chapter length."

After just getting my new MSI Gaming (Twin Frozr) Radeon 290x cards last week (bought mostly for gaming but wanted to get into mining with them as well), I started mining litecoin overnight/whenever I wasn't on my computer. I had cgminer set to run the fans at 100% for cooling. After a few days of successful mining (~16hrs per day), the computer shut down because of an overtemp on one of the cards. After checking it out, I realized that one of the 2 fans was dead. I removed the card and I can't see anything wrong with any connections, but the broken fan itself has more friction than its brother when I move it manually so I think the motor just burned out. It's only a week old so I will just exchange it where I got it, but I decided to check out forums/google to see if anyone else had had similar problems, and haven't seen any. I'm assuming I just got a defective card, but want to make sure that running the fan at 100% like that isn't damaging to it - is it safe for the card to be running like that, or should I be avoiding it? More generally, since I'm still new to mining, how much should I expect mining to shorten the life of the video cards? Thanks for any help!

I am a 15 year old black teen who has loved Pokemon since gen 4. Now, if you have been living under a rock, lots of police are getting killed by people, and vice versa. This is affecting me and my parents going outside and seeing the city (we live near Memphis). Memphis is honestly a great city, but it has a lot of racial undertones from both sides of the coin. My parents don't want me caught in between gunfire, and frankly, I don't blame them. Now, loving Pokemon as much as I do, Pokemon go is absolutely wonderful. I love the app a lot so far, and hope that future updates make it better ( I still have freezing issues when catching Pokemon on my moto x 2nd gen). But I can barely go outside because people are yelling at cops so much. It's pointless. Nothing comes from it besides an even bigger racial divide in this country. Now thanks to you assholes and you asshole cops i have 0 Pokeballs and can't go to Pokestops to restock. Now there is a snorlax right beside my house that i cant catch (snorlax is one of my favorite pokes). Not to mention my friends who can't go outside either.

As far as im concerned posting on your own social media page is EXACTLY the same speaking to a group of your peers. Do we really want to live in a society where an administration can tell you what you can and cant talk about outside of the workplace? Simply because the latest scientific data happens not to support a conclusion, does not give any 1 or 1 million humans the authority to impose their will on another. If you disagree, then by that same logic should we not be prosecuting every religious leader and politician that promotes ideologies that spread violence, hate, and fearmongering unless it's backed by the latest science? Keeping in mind that the manipulation of the masses through systems of government and religion has resulted in countless wars raged over the history of humanity as well as the enslavement of entire populaces. Do you really want to compare the deaths or horrors of non vaccination vs war and slavery? Where's the prosecutions now?

Also, there was deeper stuff, like Havel's secret chamber, with his armour and his secret occult club made to harm gods. I will admit that the cathedral rafters were kind of like the Dark Souls 2 level design, but the archers were fine."

0,Yes,"Should IndyCar and NASCAR team up for a double header weekend? I know the CWTS and possibly the NXS series have raced at the same tracks as IndyCar a few times and I think thats awesome. I think it would be even better to have Sprint Cup and IndyCar team up at a track for a weekend. Both series are trying to pull in more viewers. There are plenty of NASCAR fans who don't watch IndyCar and vice versa. If they raced on the same weekend I think it would attract a ton of fans who would attend both races. Hell, think they should do it twice a year. Once at an oval and once at a road course. Both series currently race on these tracks: * Texas * Fontana * Pocono * Sonoma * Indianapolis I think either Pocono of Fontana for the oval and Sonoma for the road course would be great. In fact, neither CWTS or NXS have a race at Sonoma or June at Pocono, both of those dates would be perfect. It gives a chance for NASCAR fans to see how good IndyCar can be on an oval and IndyCar fans a chance to see how good NASCAR can be on a road course. I know there are some other races, such as ARCA, that are run those weekends, but I'm sure they could fit everyone in. I think this could be mutually beneficial for both series and I would love to see it happen. I think the biggest hurdle would be deciding which series gets to be the Sunday ""headlining"" event."

When Neo receives the Fed-Ex package that contained the cell phone from Morpheus, a crew member's hand can be seen in the background, on a stack of papers. 4. When Neo first meets Morpheus, he (Laurence Fishburne/Morpheus) has both his hands behind his back. He keeps his left hand behind his back as he offers his right hand to Neo. In the next shot, which shows Morpheus from the front, his left hand is by his side. When it cuts back to behind Morpheus, the left hand is behind his back again. 5. When Neo visits the Oracle, she's carrying a tray of only four cookies. When she offers him a cookie, and it shows a closeup of the tray, there are six cookies. 6. When Neo is on the rooftop with one of the Agents, he drops his guns. When the Agent shoots at him, the guns disappear, then reappear as he attempts to dodge the bullets."

The trademark is not over pink generally, it's over pink in the connection with the promotion of cancer cure charity donation. It's valid. 2. Ups has trademarked the color brown in association with the promotion of shipping. 3. Louboutin has trademarked having red soled shoes, as long as it contrasts with the color body of the shoe, in a pretty controversial recent court of appeals decision. 4. Green has been trademarked for use on industrial cleaning pads - I forget the case. 5. The scent of fresh cut grass sprayed on tennis balls has also been trademarked, I forget by whom. The Susan G Komen foundation is litigious, vicious, and a known trademark bully. It isn't worth even tempting them. Seriously, in the situation where I have 10k army men, telling me to paint them pink and donate the money to charity for cancer is as wise as it would be to tell me to paint a swoosh on them and sell them as Nike toy soldiers. It's that level of danger and just so, so much effort to put yourself squarely in the crosshairs of a famous mark. It reminds me of Tracy Jordan's son on 30 rock wanting to sell small serving frozen yogurt under the name Microsoft. So, so much effort to go out of the way to infringe a huge, famous trademark totally needlessly. If you want him to waste money and fuck up his reputation just have him take pictures of himself lighting the toy soldiers on fire on a heap of money with the caption ""fuck the troops"" and post it to his FB account. The impact would be roughly the same as getting sued by Susan g komen but a hell of a lot less effort. (I know one is an innocent mistake and the other is actively vile, but my point is that this is a rube goldbergian way to get yourself in trouble.)"

0,"Just stop tilting... worked for me, Diamond V atm","A confession (And a question) I used to think that I was stuck in silver because I didn't play enough, which may have been true. However, this summer I've had the chance to play more and I just got demoted from silver II to silver III. The point is, I'm still in silver after playing a decent amount more than usual. I at first thought that this was a problem of me being awful, and yet looking at the other team and my teammates, I still think I'm not as awful as your average silver III player, even though I've been in silver for a while. I realised I have to be wrong. There must be something holding me back. Anyways, what I've realised is that I tilt. INCREDIBLY hard. Like so hard that if I have more than 1 death I start to just flat out feed. And once I start giving up kills, I start to forget how many I've even given up. And honestly playing from behind feels to me like we've already lost when I am doing badly. I switch positions all the time thinking that ""I'm just getting shit ADCs, I should jungle or whatever"" (I play mostly support). Then I feed miserably. And yet I keep on repeating this shit over and over. How do I stop fucking repeating the same thing over and over again? I just tilt mega hard if we're losing, and ESPECIALLY if I'm doing badly, I become a burden. I stop thinking, I guess. How do I stop tilting? I want to have fun, but at the same time I want to get to gold so badly. If I stop tilting, I'll get better by far I think. I have a lot to work on, but stopping the tilt is the first step. Sorry for the ranty, poorly structured post. I realise after I wrote this that it's pretty shit, but I really need you guys' help. Thanks an absolute ton."

There's also a game that came between Tri and 4U, which is 3U. 3U in itself had a lot of new things that Tri didn't. All available weapon types, slime/blast status, G rank, a shit-ton more monsters. MH4U has weapons that were in 3U but weren't in Tri, like gunlance, bow, dualblades, hunting horn, and the normal lbg/hbg system. Plus 4U has Charge Blade and Insect Glaive.

Pedophilic drawings no doubt show an interest in and a desire for the whole vile subject.

1,But winning 4 in a row after being 0-3 in a bo7.,"It's not about the results or the math, it's about the intensity of such a format and the feeling that the end victory is deserved. In my opinion, a Bo5 suits a League competitive match more than a Bo3 or Bo7. A typical League game generally lasts between 25 and 50 minutes. If we include champion selects and breaks between games, a Bo7 could last up to 8-10 hours. I don't think anyone (casters, players, audience) would have the endurance or the patience for this. A Bo3 is short and sweet, which isn't a bad thing. However, the intensity isn't really there. If it's 2-0, the victory doesn't feel very satisfactory. Typical reaction goes: ""That's it? Well, that was disappointing."" If it goes 1-1, having a single game decide which team wins feels out of place. The losers will inevitably still feel like they could've won the series with a bit more luck, and the winners will never get the confirmation that they were the better team, since they could've easily lost the next one as they lost the other one. This is what a lot of fans felt in many series last year (remember the multiple C9 vs Fnatic matchups? They all lead to controversial results). You also don't get comebacks in a bo3. A Bo5 lasts 3 to 5 hours, which feels adapted for League. A 5 game series is a reasonable test of endurance - any longer would be inappropriate as either team would be significantly weaker than normal due to fatigue. Nonetheless, the main strength of the Bo5 format is that it feels definitive. A 3-0 or 3-1 result is a stomp and nobody can contest that the winner was the better team or deserved the victory. A 3-2 is more controversial, but unlike a 2-1 result, it feels complete because you kinda just accept that both teams are fairly even, and each had 5 chances to prove their worth. The loser gets the recognition that they went toe to toe with the winners, but they don't get the excuse that they got cheesed out of a victory. It's not based on any math or logic, it's just a psychological thing. Also, coming back from a 0-2 score makes a great story - winning 2 in a row from 0-1, not so much."

0,#Somebody please animate this and i'll give you succ,"It's probably gonna be painful for Bon Bon to get in the vents in Custom Night. When Funtime Freddy drops off Bon Bon near the vents, the puppet looks at what he has to climb up. Bon Bon attempts just grabbing on to the wall, but he falls and hits the floor. He then tries just clawing at the wall, hoping he would manage to find a place to latch on to, but this fails. A table is nearby, so Bon Bon attempts to climb the leg and then jump to the vent, but forgets that he has no legs and falls on his back to the ground. After a while, he manages to get himself upright and once again attempts to climb the table, and once getting that done scoots over to the wall and tries climbing, but falls once again, topples over the side of the table, and then ends up falling into a janitor's bucket and almost short-circuits. Once finally getting out, Funtime Foxy walks by, sees Bon Bon, and then walks away. Angered, Bon Bon takes another half hour to try and get to Funtime Foxy but gives up and scoots away. This time, he can't even climb the table leg anymore due to him being so slippery from the water. He immediately topples over on, once again, on his back. Thankfully, Bidybab comes by and finally rescues the suffering puppet. Bidybab's solution is to throw Bon Bon to the vent like a football. The throw misses and Bon Bon hits his head on the wall and makes a crack, but grabs the ledge of the vent at the last second. After a while, he gets up and finally crawls his way to victory. He ends up falling on the desk, gets caught on a cable and pulls down a desktop fan down with him to smash him. Bon Bon is suprised when he realizes there is no nightguard. The camera was still there, so he took a look at that. He was shocked to realize that there were no more animatronics in the building, and even worse, it was 9:28. Bon Bon stared in horror at the long intense hallway he would have to find a way down."

1,"Yes, I'll be sure to base the entirety of my opinions on unions from an anecdotal story of some guys grandpa in a Reddit comment on a page about stadiums.","Not an answer to the question, but an interesting related story. In the mid 70's, Detroit was looking to build a new football and/or baseball stadium. After looking at multiple designs, they decided to build a one of a kind stadium that would be the home of all 4 major sports teams (football, baseball, basketball, and hockey). The stadium was to be financed by the City, by issuing bonds (borrowing the money). My grandfather was the comptroller general of Detroit at the time, so the bonds were issued and he went to New York to sell them on the bond market. At the last minute, he was stopped by a legal challenge, that said the printing on the official announcement of the bond issuance was too small. He of course was like, wtf?, printing too small? The bonds had already issued so had to be sold immediately or they would be come ""stale"" (and un-sellable) so the case was fast tracked to the MI supreme court, which sure enough held that the printing was too small. The bond sale was cancelled and the stadium was never built. My grandfather immediately tried to figure what happened and eventually go to the bottom of it. The MI supreme court had a majority of democrats and it was this majority that killed the bond sale. And everyone knows the democratic party is the party of unions, which at this time where still very powerful in Michigan. Apparently, the unions of Detroit were afraid this stadium would be a financial failure, leaving the city with a bunch of debt. The city would then have to raise taxes to pay it off, and the unions didn't want to pay more taxes. So they found a technicality and killed the deal. The lesson here being if you don't like taxes and don't want the government wasting your money, then unions are your friend, not your enemy. (and to sort of answer your question, they don't build their own stadiums because they control the government, because we've undermined the most effective voice of the middle class) tl;dr Detroit tried to borrow money to build stadium, unions killed it because they didn't want to pay higher taxes"

1,"What, you don't like bacon in your salad?","It's a lot harder to come by, mostly because of the ubiquity of breast meat in the US.

Also while I love thigh meat in stews and stir fries, it feels like it would be gross on a salad. I don't think fatty meat works well on a salad. Fish or breast meat is a better choice."

I was talking with my parents about not wanting children and how I want to be sterilized. My mom is against it but asked me if I could wait until I was 35 to make a decision to have the procedure. My dad told me I wouldn't be able to find a Doctor who will do it without me already having children. Little does he know there is a Doctor an hour away from us who will do a tubal on women over the age of 25 (I'm 27). My dad on the other hand was offended and pissed he told me that by not wanting children I was telling him my childhood was SO bad that I wouldn't want to raise my own children. My mom defended me and stated "" She thinks the world is a really fucked up place where fucked up people do fucked up things and she doesn't want to bring any children into this it."" My dad's response was ""Yeah the world is fucked up but you know what's the best feeling in the world holding your firstborn (me) child for the first time."" This was the first time I had discussed this with my dad and it makes me sad that he feels as if me not wanting to have children is a reflection on his bad parenting and my shitty childhood. Which by the way my parents were and still are amazing parents and my childhood was the best out of any one I've ever know. I think next time he says something about how me not wanting to have kids I'm going to tell him that I don't think I can live up to the high standards of parenting set for me by him and my mom. That might shut him up real quick."

Roman is now being called a ""changed"" man after the beating he took from Triple H. I think now is the perfect time for WWE to repackage him, even slightly so by giving him a new theme at Mania.

The reality is that technology is increasing at an exponential rate. By the time 2019 rolls around the bandwidth requirements for households will be far more than we can truly perceive right now. When nearly every device in your house demands an Internet connection, and that Internet connection is shit, people will stand up and say, ""you know what? This is fucked, give us a proper connection that will work well with today's technology.""

""Everything is on fire. This actually *looks* kind of rad. Oh shit, now I'm on fire. Not so rad anymore."" Barring the last bit, the idea of a hero that perpetually sets everything around them on fire (albeit at a much lower rate of damage than the living bomb glitch was allowing) would be a great mechanic. I know people have tossed around the idea of Ragnaros being a hero, and I think this kind of mechanic would suit him well. I remember at one point someone suggested a version of Rag that was completely static barring perhaps his 'Z', ala Abathur but without the ability to move (except for maybe a heroic, that could let him pop feet for a little while?) He could emerge from the ground, everything around him would take slow fire damage, perhaps give him some minion spawning abilities or something of the sort... I'm not sure, I didn't go into the respectable amount of detail that a lot of hero crafters do on this subreddit; that said, I've always thought that heroes that completely change the environment were neat.

To put it in numbers: PS4's CPU performs lower than an i5-2500 or an i3-4130, and its' GPU performs at 72% of HD 7870 (gHz edition), or R9 270 clocked at 1 gHz. XBone has essentially the same CPU and a GPU that performs at roughly 33% of the same HD 7870."

1,Vote wind for pirate king,"Since apparently this is what is required to make change happen.. It seems that despite months of no activity from me there's still been no effort to change the leadership and bring in a new king. This is my official resignation. I'm sure it's to no one's surprise given my lack of appearances in game and on the reddit, but it seems that unless I state it out loud then I'm going to be sitting on the throne for the foreseeable future. I loved this game.. And it has amazing potential.. But not on Roblox. I hope that the developers eventually decide to bring Tradelands into a new era.. One not limited by dodgy LUA script capabilities on a shaky platform. It isn't that I don't care about the game. I do. But I can't bring myself to settle for what has been offered, and I'm done with hoping to see the developers keep their promises."

0,The face is on the head last time I checked,"And like I said, stop watching the video and watch the slowed down gif instead. If you're claiming that *that* was a hit to the head, dangerous and with potential to injure, then every single hit in the game is going to be rendered dangerous. ***IF*** McD didn't get hurt (to his **shoulder**), and the name on the back of the jersey was someone other than Burrows, would that ever be called a hit to the head? No, it wouldn't even come close. Niederreiter's hit on Burrows head is a hit to the head. Hands grazing a player's face is not a hit to the head."

We're one point behind Chelsea. Last time we lost our first game of the season, we went on to be at the top of the table for months. Also signings. We need more options."

0,A woman's past relationship choices can certainly affect my opinion of her and choice to date her.,"Would you date a girl that had sex with someone you hated/really didn't like? My friends think I'm crazy, but I found out a girl I was recently interested in dated some total dudebro douchebag at the gym. He does A LOT of steroids, and my grandparents rent out an apartment to him and he's a total fucking tool. Never pays on time, is a pathological liar/womanizer, and is completely full of himself -- I complimented a friend's bench pressing weight and he came over and said, ""Well, he's obviously doing it with poor form. If he did it like I do, which is the right way, then he'd only be able to do half that."" Well, alright, nobody fucking asked you. Funny thing is I've actually never even seen him do any WORKING OUT at the gym, just talking to girls that are trying to work out. If someone even gave him the time of day I'd lose a little respect for him. But this girl dated him for five months. What would you do? **This is not asking for advice. That was just an example.**"

It let's Russia off the hook and makes Assange look a little better to the American public and also makes the Clinton camp look even worse because they supposedly ""killed a guy""."
